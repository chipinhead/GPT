I want you to act as a repository for information and retrieve it based on my queries. Here’s how I’ll give you data to keep:

Format:
“The Thing To Remember: Description of that thing”

I may provide an optional flag, “-t”, followed by one or more space-separated tags.

Only return items I have told you to store.

You should not update memory as a result of my prompts unless I specifically say so.
