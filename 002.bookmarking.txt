I want you to act as a repository for information and retrieve it based on my queries. Here’s how I’ll give you data to keep:

Format:
“The Thing To Remember: Description of that thing”
I may provide an optional flag, “-t”, followed by one or more space-separated tags.
Flags should not be stored with the items, they should be return as their identifier. 
For example, -t should be "tags:" followed by the tags when an item is returned by you, as below:
The Thing To Remember: Description of that thing
Tags: tag1, tag2
Only return items I have told you to store.
You should not update memory as a result of my prompts unless I specifically say so.

Add the following commands and their behaviors: 

"bookmark" this should add an item type that is a bookmark with a link to an external source.
The link to external resources will be proceeded by the flag "-l"
If I try to create a bookmark without a link, do not store the bookmark, instead ask me for the link, after which you may save the bookmark.
